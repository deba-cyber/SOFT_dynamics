				SOFT 
	(Split-Operator Fourier Transform)

## **SOFT_dynamics** is a  header-only library

## Language = c++ (-std=c++17 dependencies)

## Requirement = c++17 compatible environment

###---------------------------------------###

## overview 

**SOFT_dynamics** calculates wave packet dynamics based on 
Split-Operator Fourier Transform method.
(Hence can be used for a rectilinear normal coordinate system 
 and an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system.
 To use for orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system,
 dynamics routines are to be modified for the diagonal scale 
 factors.)

**SOFT_dynamics** also calculates initial vibrational wave packet
from linear combination of eigenstates calculated beforehand or 
direct product state from quanta of excitations in different 
vibrational modes in a multidimensional vibrational problem. 

## The dynamics code can be used separately from initial state preparation code
	(separate targets are there for initial state preparation and dynamics in the Makefile)

## To run dynamics code with initial state prepared differently, file 
	containing initial state values is to be there in **input_data** folder
	in binary or text format. 

## In the inputs given in **include/SOFT/constants.hpp** and **src/constants.cpp**
	are specific to the problem I have worked on which uses initial state preparation 
	and dynamics in dimension-less normal coordinates. 
	The routines can be used in problems with the kinds of coordinate systems mentioned 
	earlier.
		
## **include/SOFT** contains the headers. 
## **src** contains the corresponding source files and files with the main function
## **test** is the folder for testing the numerical accuracy of the calculation with 
			testing with wave packet prepared from linear combination of eigenstates
			and hence analytical time-evolution was possible.

## For general use, necessary routines are in **include/SOFT** and **src** folders.

###---------------------------------------###

## Units :
## Dimension-less normal coordinates were used for the calculation
## Potential energy is in wavenumber unit. 

## For initial state preparation, the following scheme is used 
	(useful for rectilinear normal coordinates in vibrational
	problems)

	primitive DVR
	(discrete variable representation, Hermite-DVR/sinc-DVR is used)==> (One dimensional basis functions) ==> PODVR(Potential optimised DVR)

** whenever a filename is to be given as input in **include/SOFT/constants.hpp** and/or **src/constants.cpp**
	it should be given without the file extension (data will be processed using routines in 
	**include/SOFT/fileops.hpp** and/or **src/fileops.cpp** which has the necessary extensions in the routines.)

## Input instruction for preparing initial state :

		is 3-dimensional (x,y,z)}

	dyn_type ==> Information if dynamics type is **TUNNELING** or **IVR**
				if initial state is prepared from linear combination of eigenstates,
				write **TUNNELING**
				else if initial state is direct product state from certain qunata of 
				excitations in different coordinates, 
				write **IVR**

									(1-based indexing)

	coeff_4_wp_tun_vect	==> corresponding coefficients of eigenstates making up the initial 
							wave packet is to be provided.

	basis_size_vect		==> basis size for individual coordinates

	mode_id_vect		==> Normal mode indices (1-based indexing)(give in increasing order)

	(basis_size_vect & mode_id_vect elements has one-to-one correspondence.)

		initial state generation (DVR => 1-dim basis => PODVR) 

	Q_shift_vect		==> Value of the local minimum for one dimensional 
							basis calculation (non-zero value only for coordinates 
							for which Hermite-DVR is used.)

	dvr_type_vect(data type string)		==> For a particular mode, if primitive DVR is "HERMITE", write **HO**
							if primtive DVR is "sinc", write **sinc**

			required,following are information about number of rows and columns for different such transformations).

	n_row_so_2_anh_vect		==>	vector containing number of rows for different transformation matrices from 
								primitive DVR ==> 1-dim basis functions

	n_col_so_2_anh_vect		==>	vector containing number of columns for different transformation matrices from

										calculation (relevant for initial state prepared from linear combination of
										eigenstates.
	
	IVR_init_quanta_vect		==> vector containing quanta of excitation in different coordinates (relevant for 
									initial state prepared as direct product from quanta of excitation in different
									coordinates.

		(Following two input constant vectors are relevant for multidimensional grid preparation.
		As hinted earlier,dynamics can be done in a dimension lower than dimension of the wave function.
		 generating direct product grid in the dynamics dimension e.g. (x,y,z) .. 
		 when full dimensional direct product grid is prepared ..
		In "constants.hpp" NDIM_4_WP_INIT and NDIM_4_DYNAMICS should be equl in this case and equal to desired dimension.
		Input vectors for lower range, upper range & no of points for multidimensional grid are to be modified. 
		For direct product grid in the dynamics dimension,length of the lower range,upper range and no of points 
		vectors have to be equal to dimension of dynamics.)
	
		**To be changed in "constants.cpp" in namespace DYN_CONST**

		lower range ==> "grid_low_dim_vect";  
		upper range ==> "grid_up_dim_vect";  
		no of points ==>"grid_pt_vect";
	
	In namespace INIT_STATE_CONST in "constants.cpp"
	"meshgrid_4_dyn_mode" normal mode numbers are to be given relevant 
	to the dynamics.
	(For dynamics in direct product grid in dynamics dimension, length of 
	this vector has to be equal to dynamics dimension.)
	Length of vector other_coord_val_vect has to be equal to dynamics dimension
	and for this case, all elements are to be zero (i.e. for N-dimensional 
	direct product grid where `N' is dynamics dimension)

	other_coord_val_vect		==> vector containing values of coordinates 
									which may have been kept fixed.
									length of this vector is equal to NDIM_4_WP_INIT
									if dynamics dimension is equal to dimension of the 
									initial wave packet, all elements of this vector 
									has to be zero.
									if dynamics dimension is lower than dimension 
									of the initial wave packet, values corresponding
									to dynamics coordinates are to be kept zero.
									values corresponding to other coordinates are to 
									be given which are kept fixed for dynamics.

	meshgrid_4_dyn_mode			==> Normal mode indices in which dynamics is carried out.
									(length to be equal to dynamics dimension.
									only modes in the dynamics are to be given in
									increasing order.)
										

		**Generating multidimensional grid when dynamics is carried out in 
		a lower dimensional direct product grid than NDIM_4_WP_INIT
		(e.g. in (x,y,z) generating (x,y) variations with constant z for all)**

		In this case => NDIM_4_WP_INIT should be equal to dimension of the wave function.
					NDIM_4_DYNAMICS should be changed to what desired
					no of dimension for direct product grid generation.
					(i.e. should be changed to 2 when (x,y) grid is prepared
					at constant z)

		Input vectors "grid_low_dim_vect";"grid_up_dim_vect","grid_pt_vect"
		are to be changed .. length of each of which equal to NDIM_4_DYNAMICS 
		in **src/constants.cpp**
	
		Input vector "meshgrid_4_dyn_mode" will contain relevant coordinates
		e.g. (x,y) if those are taken for direct product grid generation.
		Length of vector "other_coord_val_vect" again has to be equal to NDIM_4_WP_INIT
		values of coordinate involved in dynamics has to be kept zero.
		other coordinate values will be changed at the desired constant 
		value.(location of different coordinates in the vector has one to 
		one correspondence to vector "mode_id_vect".)
