"binary_fileops.py" ==> file for processing binary file generated from
dynamics.

function `get_data_from_bin' creates animation for 1d/2d figures.
Two dimensional figure can be surface/contour.

Necessary inputs are to be provided in file "process_bin.inp"

1. first line ==> binary file name

2. second line ==> dimension| plottype | calculation type

	plottype can be surface/contour for two dimensional case.

3. Third line ==> Total number of data points.

4. Fourth line ==> For slow coordinate in plotting 
					
					lower limit | upper limit | axis label

5. Fifth line ==> For fast coordinate in plotting 
					
					lower limit | upper limit | axis label

6. Sixth line ==> 
data points in slow coordinate | data points in fast coordinate

7. seventh line ==> location where animation/pdfs for figures will be saved.

8. eighth line ==> animation filename

9. Ninth line ==> pdf file names without index which is coded.


10.10-th line gives the timesteps for which data were saved in binary file.
	In general, data can be saved for a large number of times and only a few
	frames may be necessary for animation.
	This code is not flexible to do that. Assumtion is number of times data 
	are saved is still small such that animation wouldn't be time-consuming 
	for practical purposes.
	If data were saved after every n-th step then 10-th line will contain only 
	one element.
	Else, all the timesteps are provided.

	For analytical calculation in Q1-Q10, 
	{10,50,100,150,200,250,300,400,500.600.750,900,1000} times are used (in
	femto second)

11.	11-th line ==> frames per second
12. 12-th line ==> time-step( for analytical calculation, use time-step 0.2)
